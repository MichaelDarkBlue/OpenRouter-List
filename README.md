# OpenRouter-List
# OpenRouter Model Browser

A lightweight HTML/JavaScript page that displays available AI models from [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/) with **live filtering**, **price filtering**, **name search**, and **model browsing**.

Built with:
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Modern **dark mode** + **neon green** theme
- No backend required â€” runs 100% client-side

---

## Features

- **Load Models**: Fetches the latest list of OpenRouter models once and caches them locally.
- **Filter by Cost**: Limit models by maximum prompt or completion price (per token).
- **Filter by Name**: Search and filter models live as you type.
- **Show All Models**: Override cost filtering to display every loaded model.
- **Reset Filters**: Quickly reset cost and name filters to defaults.
- **Dark Mode UI**: Sleek, neon-green outlined design with hover effects.
- **No API Key Needed**: Public models are fetched without authentication.

## Notes

- The model list is pulled from OpenRouter's public `/api/v1/models` endpoint.
- Data is cached after loading to avoid unnecessary repeated API calls.
- Only public model metadata is shown; no inference or completion requests are made.
- Prices are **per token**, based on prompt or output generation, not per full request.

---

## Future Improvements

- Add sorting by price, name, or context length.
- Add pagination for very large lists.
- Display provider information or additional model capabilities.
- Allow saving favorite models.
